		<p style="font-size: 1.5vw">Hello again! I'm Zaynah Javed, a second year at UC Berkeley double majoring in Computer Science and Data Science. I was born in Nashville, Tennessee in the hospital where my dad was doing his residency, but moved to the northwest suburbs of Chicago, Illinois right after and have lived there my entire life!</p>
		<p style="font-size: 1.5vw">In my free time I love going to the gym, running, listening to music, learning about astrophysics, and aimlessly browsing the internet.</p>
